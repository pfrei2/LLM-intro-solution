This makes the function more robust.\\n    *   **Rule 3 (Divisible by 400)**: `if year % 400 == 0: return True`\\n        *   This is the most specific rule. If a year is divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000, 2400), it\\'s always a leap year. This condition is checked first because it overrides the \"divisible by 100\" rule.\\n    *   **Rule 2 (Divisible by 100 but not 400)**: `elif year % 100 == 0: return False`\\n        *   If the year wasn\\'t divisible by 400, but it *is* divisible by 100 (e.g., 1900, 2100), then it\\'s *not* a leap year.\\n    *   **Rule 1 (Divisible by 4 but not 100)**: `elif year % 4 == 0: return True`\\n        *   If the year wasn\\'t covered by the previous two rules (i.e., not divisible by 100 or 400), but it *is* divisible by 4 (e.g., 2004, 2008), then it\\'s a leap year.\\n    *   **Else (Not a leap year)**: `else: return False`\\n        *   If none of the above conditions are met, the year is not divisible by 4, and therefore not a leap year (e.g., 2001, 2002).\\n\\n2.  **`is_leap_year_oneliner(year: int) -> bool:`**:\\n    *   This version implements the same logic more compactly using a single boolean expression: `(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)`.\\n    *   This expression directly translates the rules:\\n        *   `(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0)` covers years like 2004 (divisible by 4, not by 100).\\n        *   `or (year % 400 == 0)` covers years like 2000 (divisible by 400, which implicitly handles being divisible by 4 and 100).\\n\\n3.  **`calendar.isleap()`**: Python\\'s `calendar` module provides a built-in function `isleap()` that performs this check reliably. For production code, it\\'s generally recommended to use built-in library functions when available, as they are well-tested and often optimized.'"

      "\" Sous le Sable\", or \"under the sand\", is a traditional North African technique that's both primal and poetic. Essentially, you bury the lamb, typically a leg or shoulder, in a pit filled with hot sand, which is heated by embers or charcoal. The sand acts as a gentle, even heat source, cooking the lamb slowly and infusing it with a subtle, smoky flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "To execute this technique, you first prepare the lamb by seasoning it with a blend of aromatic spices, herbs, and sometimes even rose petals. Then, you dig a pit, line it with hot coals, and cover them with a layer of sand. The lamb is placed on top, and then covered with more sand, creating a sort of underground oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the lamb cooks, the sand absorbs and distributes the heat, cooking the meat to a tender, fall-off-the-bone texture. The result is a dish that's both rustic and refined, with a depth of flavor that's simply sublime. When you finally unearth the lamb, the aroma is intoxicating, and the first bite is a revelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this technique requires some patience and planning, but the payoff is well worth it. In my Michelin-starred kitchen, we like to serve the lamb sous le sable with a side of preserved lemon and olives, which complements the rich, gamey flavors perfectly. It's a true culinary experience that will transport your taste buds to the souks of Marrakech.\n"
